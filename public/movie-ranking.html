<h1>The Fabulous Movies According to Rituja</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 movies of all-time. </h2>
<hr/>
<h2>1. PONYO </h2>
<p>Ponyo films a film made in 2010 and directed by Hayao Miyazaki and is about a boy looking after a little fish-like creature. overall the film's plot is really simple, when it comes down to it not a lot, happens in this film but I think this works in the film's favour as its very easy for kids to understand the really deep themes it presents such as growing up, responsibility and Friendship. it all just flows together really well, with the way Sosuke takes responsibility and looks after Ponyo when she is a little fish</p>
<h2>2. US </h2>
<p>A masterpiece of identity horror & dark reflection on America's past with chilly atmospherics, originality in concept, psychological torment + twists, old-world suspense-building, and one of the best scorings in modern Horror history.</p>
<h2>3. GET OUT </h2>
<p>The breakout film for comedian turned filmmaker, 2017's "Get Out" is a brilliantly written and directed thriller that delivers a much needed social commentary on race relations in America while depicting the deep rooted fears Black people endure amongst a White society.</p>
